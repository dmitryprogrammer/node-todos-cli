# Node Todos CLI

Here you can see simple CLI tool for management of todo list.
This project I created for practice NodeJS.

Here you can install it and run it by commands.
add,
delete,
update,
list,
clear-tasks

I think purpose of all these commands is obvious.

During progress I will update this README, stay tuned.
